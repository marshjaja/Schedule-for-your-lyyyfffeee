 <h1>DESCRIPTION 📖</h1>

# 👩🏾‍💻🏳️‍🌈Marcia Mijnhijmer🏳️‍🌈👩🏾‍💻 Makes a Simple Work Schedule App - Schedule For Your Lyyyfffeee

## Task: <br/>
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

# User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule <br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively<br>
<br>

# Acceptance Criteria
The app should:

Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
Persist events between refreshes of a page


# Things I want to improve(these are just a few...):
- Organize individual values for the textareas inputs, so they have separate storage.
- Remove button removes per line in textareas, so if the delete button is pressed not everything will be removed in the hour time/ timeid
- better logic and handle of the dates thats are being displayed , correctness
- better handling of the hide logic if no day is chosen to schedule in
